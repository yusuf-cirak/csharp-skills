# Application caching — hybrid L1/L2 (shared reference)

Linked from `hardening` (Application Caching) and `csharp` (keyed DI cache stores). Owns *how* an
in-process cache layer is built. Don't hand-roll a cache, and don't run a bare `IMemoryCache` or
`IDistributedCache` directly — neither gives you stampede protection, fail-safe, or cross-node
invalidation, and you'll re-implement all three badly.

## Library pick

**FusionCache** (`ZiggyCreatures.FusionCache`) is the default. It is a hybrid cache: a fast in-process
**L1** in front of a shared **L2** (Redis), with cache-stampede protection, fail-safe, soft/hard
timeouts, and a backplane — all built in. (.NET 9's `HybridCache` is the framework's lighter take on the
same idea; reach for it only when its smaller feature set is genuinely enough.)

## Rules

- **L1 + L2 + backplane.** In-memory L1 for hot reads; Redis L2 shared across instances; a **backplane**
  (Redis pub/sub) so a write on one node evicts/updates that key's L1 on **every** node — otherwise nodes
  serve stale L1 entries until expiry.
- **L2 serializer:** MessagePack (`FusionCacheNeueccMessagePackSerializer`) over JSON for L2 payloads —
  smaller and faster on the hot path.
- **Stampede protection** is the main reason to use this: concurrent misses for the same key collapse to a
  **single** factory call; the rest await it. Never let N requests all rebuild the same entry.
- **Fail-safe:** on a factory failure (the backing call throws/times out) serve the **stale** value past
  its logical expiry instead of propagating the error — availability over freshness for cacheable reads.
- **Factory soft-timeout:** bound how long a read waits on the backing call; on soft-timeout return stale
  (fail-safe) and let the refresh complete in the background, so one slow dependency can't stall callers.
- **Jitter** expiry (a few % / a few seconds) so keys written together don't all expire on the same tick
  and stampede the backing store at once.
- **Never cache** authenticated/per-user responses in a shared L2 under a non-user-scoped key, secrets, or
  anything the `hardening` redaction policy forbids logging. Scope the key by tenant/user where the value
  is principal-specific.

## Sketch

```csharp
services.AddFusionCache()
    .WithDefaultEntryOptions(o =>
    {
        o.Duration = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(5);
        o.JitterMaxDuration = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(10);
        o.IsFailSafeEnabled = true;                          // serve stale on factory failure
        o.FailSafeMaxDuration = TimeSpan.FromHours(1);
        o.FactorySoftTimeout = TimeSpan.FromMilliseconds(100);
    })
    .WithSerializer(new FusionCacheNeueccMessagePackSerializer())
    .WithDistributedCache(sp => sp.GetRequiredService<IDistributedCache>()) // Redis L2
    .WithBackplane(new RedisBackplane(new() { Configuration = redisConnString }));

var product = await cache.GetOrSetAsync(
    $"product:{id}", _ => repo.LoadAsync(id, ct), token: ct);  // misses collapse to one factory call
```
